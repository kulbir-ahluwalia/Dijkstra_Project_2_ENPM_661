# Dijkstra_Project_2_ENPM_661

## Instructions on Running the code

1. Change the directory to the Code folder containing Dijkstra_rigid.py
2. Type "python3 Dijkstra_rigid.py" in the terminal
3. Enter the desired radius, clearance, start position and goal position.
4. For example, the start and goal position is input as [5,5] and [295,195].
5. Wait for 40 seconds and then the animation will pop up. The cost and time to completion will also be printed.

## Libraries used in the code
1. **cv2**
2. **numpy**
3. **math**
4. **matplotlib**
5. **time**

The test code folder contains jupyter notebooks used in the making of the code.
